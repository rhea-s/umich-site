								<h3>Chinese Mutual Aid Association Portal</h3>
								As part of JP Morgan Chase's "Code for Good" hackathon in Chicago, this website was built in the course of 18 hours. I built 75% of the front-end in HTML/Bootstrap/CSS while my 5 team members helped with the rest of the front-end and built the back-end in Flask Python. Here I've bypassed the login screen so you can access the three user types: <a href="templates/admin.html">admin</a>, <a href="templates/grades.html">parent</a>, and <a href="templates/studentoptions.html">student</a>.<br><br>
								In the admin page, I built the accordian drop-downs that allow staff members to check on student progress, and the pending notifications of students who need to be enrolled. I built the entire parent portal, which allows parents to view their children's progress and feedback, and renew their enrollment or enroll a new child, including a form that translates to Vietnamese for parents who speak little English. I built the main student landing page and the math game that is designed to gamify the learning process for children to reduce the workload on the staff members.<br><br>
								<h3>Mercedes-Benz TMU Reporting Application</h3>
								Over the past summer, I interned with Mercedes-Benz. They had an application which needed to be updated, so I was tasked with building a new version from scratch. I built a login, a sidebar form with customizable options, and the main screen with reporting results displayed quickly, concisely, and attractively. To build these reports, I used various open-source graph and map tools. I accessed Mercedes-Benz's consumer databases to retrieve the necessary data and formatted it to be displayed using the tools mentioned before. The site was built mostly using Bulma (a framework similar to Bootstrap), HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I used Java/JDBC and mySQL for the back-end integration with the database. 
								<br><br>Although the finished product cannot be shown directly, here are some screenshots:<br><br>
